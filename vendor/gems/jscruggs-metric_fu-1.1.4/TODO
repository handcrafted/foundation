== TODO list

* Color code flog results with scale from: http://jakescruggs.blogspot.com/2008/08/whats-good-flog-score.html
* Integrate Flog, Saikuro, and Coverage into one report so you can see methods that have high complexity and low coverage (this is a big one)
* Update flog specs so that they actually run flog
* Add flay specs that run flay
* Convert readme to markdown and rename to README.mkdn so github will render it
* Saikuro.rb falls over if tries to parse an empty file.  Fair enough.  We shouldn't feed it empty files
* Make running metric_fu on metric_fu less embarrassing
