# = New Relic Agent
#
# New Relic RPM is a performance monitoring application for Ruby applications running
# in production.  For more information on RPM please visit http://www.newrelic.com.
#
# The New Relic Agent can be installed in Ruby applications to gather runtime performance
# metrics, traces, and errors for display in a Developer Mode UI (mapped to /newrelic in your application 
# server) or for monitoring and analysis at http://rpm.newrelic.com.
#
# For detailed information on configuring or customizing the RPM Agent please visit our
# {support and documentation site}[http://support.newrelic.com].
#
# == Starting the Agent as a Gem
#
# For Rails, add:
#    config.gem 'newrelic_rpm'
# to your initialization sequence.
#
# For merb, do 
#    dependency 'newrelic_rpm'
# in the Merb config/init.rb
#
# For other frameworks, or to manage the agent manually, invoke NewRelic::Agent#manual_start
# directly.
#
# == Configuring the Agent
# 
# All agent configuration is done in the +newrelic.yml+ file.  This file is by
# default read from the +config+ directory of the application root and is subsequently
# searched for in the application root directory, and then in a +~/.newrelic+ directory
#
# == Agent APIs
#
# The agent has some APIs available for extending and customizing.
#
# :main: lib/new_relic/agent.rb
