v2.9.1.
  * add newrelic_ignore_apdex method to controller classes to allow
    you to omit some actions from apdex statistics
  * Add hook for Passenger shutdown events to get more timely shutdown
    notices; this will help in more accurate memory readings in 
    Passenger

    performance and reliability implications

  Noteworthy Enhancements
  * give visibility to templates and partials in Rails 2.1 and later, in
    dev mode and production
  * change active record metrics to capture statistics in adapter log()
    call, resulting in lower overhead and improved visibility into
    different DB operations; only AR operations that are not hitting the
    query cache will be measured to avoid overhead
  * added mongrel_rpm to the gem, a standalone daemon listening for custom
    metric values sent from local processes (experimental); do mongrel_rpm
    --help
  * add API for system monitoring daemons (refer to KB articles); changed
    API for manual starting of the agent; refer to
    NewRelic::Agent.manual_start for details
  * do certificate verification on ssl connections to 
    collector.newrelic.com
  * support instances appearing in more than one application by allowing a
    semicolon separated list of names for the newrelic.yml app_name
    setting.

  * use rpm server time for transaction traces rather than agent time

  Developer Mode (only) Enhancements

  Compatibility Enhancements

    is not accessible from an unsupported platform
  * jruby will no longer start the agent now when running the console or 
    rake tasks
  * API support for RPM as a footnote add-in
  * webrick support restored
  
  Noteworthy bugfixes
